A quiz app for the Scoops!
 I'm new to javascript, working on an app to run quizzes for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social podcast. A couple of Las Vegas improv guys
 talk about stuff, go down bit rabbit holes, answer Scoop Mail, and compete in a Jock vs Nerd game of sorts each podcast. Some listeners
 have designed web apps to help other listeners create more engaging quizzes, and I'm trying my hand at it here to get some practice.
